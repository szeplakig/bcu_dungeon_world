## Requires and Replaces

Some moves that you gain at higher levels depend on other moves. If another move is listed along with the word Requires or Replaces you can only gain the new move if you have the listed move. 
A move that requires another move can only be taken if you have the move it requires already. You then have both moves and they both apply.
A move that replaces another move can only be taken if you have the move it replaces already. You lose access to the replaced move and just have the new one. The new move will usually include all the benefits of the replaced one: maybe you replace a move that gives you 1 armor with one that gives you 2 armor instead.

## Beyond 10th Level

Once youâ€™ve reached 10th level things change a little. When you have enough XP to go to 11th level instead you choose one of these:

* Retire to safety
* Take on an apprentice
* Change entirely to a new class
  If you retire you create a new character to play instead and work with the GM to establish your place in the world. 
  If you take on an apprentice you play a new character (the apprentice) alongside your current character, who stops gaining XP. 
  Changing classes means keeping your ability scores, race, HP, and whatever moves you and the GM agree are core to who your character is. You lose all other class moves, replacing them with the starting moves of your new class.

## Compendium playbooks

Compendium playbooks all have a trigger condition you must achieve within the story to access them. When you do, on your next level-up, you may take that Compendium playbook's opening move.

The latter moves can be taken at any later level-up, if the first move has been unlocked. You do not lose any of your original playbook's moves you have already unlocked, and may take moves from them as well.

Some Compendium playbooks have Death Moves as well. These work like an Alternative Death Move - if your Death Move would trigger, you can choose to trigger either your Compendium playbook's, or your original playbook's Death Move.

## Short Description

An **Allomancer** is a being able to harness the power of _specific_ Allomentic metals or alloys, drawing upon their inherent properties to achieve feats that defy natural law. Through ingesting and "burning" these metals, they unlock latent abilities ranging from enhanced senses to manipulating objects or emotions.

Depending on their mastery and the quality and preparation of the Allomentic metal ingested, the strength of these effects can vary. Treading the line between science and magic, an Allomancer must be strategic in their metal use, balancing power with the potential for adverse effects.

Whether they're soaring through the skies with Steel pushes or sensing dangers before they arise with Tin, Allomancers are a force to be reckoned with in any scenario.

## Stats

Your maximum HP is 8+Constitution.

Your base damage is d6.

## Starting moves

### Novice Allomancer

- **Description**: Your journey into the realm of Allomancy has just begun, and you've familiarized yourself with a few metals.
- **Effect**: You can recognize, prepare, ingest, and burn up to 2 different Allomantic metals. (These are locked in forever.)

### Prepare Metal

Before using your Allomantic abilities, you must prepare a specific metal or alloy Allomentically for Ingestion.

This process is delicate and can cause harm or provide a weaker effect.

Use up 1 times the metal cost of coins + 4 coins worth of chemicals to create INT+1 uses of Allomantic metal.

**Roll+INT** to determine the outcome.

- **On a 10+**: The metal is perfectly prepared.
- **On a 7-9**: You prepare the metal but something happens. Choose from the following:
    - **Weak draft**: You create a Weak Allomatic Metal batch. This means these powers are weaker.
    - **Accident**: You mess up during the process and hurt yourself but still manage to complete the batch. Take 1 small harm.
    - **Wastage**: You waste a lot of materials. You only get half (rounded up) the amount of Allomantic Metal uses.
- **On a miss**: You've made a grave mistake in preparation. You lose the batch. The GM will decide the consequences. Choose from the following:
    - **Nothing**: You have managed to leave the room before it filled up with toxic fumes.
    - **Resource Drain**: Your preparation was so off that youâ€™ve wasted not only the intended materials but also additional resources. Lose an amount of coins equal to the initial cost.
    - **Cuts**: You cut your hand with a sharp piece. *ouchie, ouchie* Suffer -1 ongoing until you rest for a longer or get healed.
    - **Explosion**: Your preparation goes horribly wrong, resulting in a small explosion. Take 1 harm (burn) and you are thrown into a chaotic situation.
    - **Allomantic Backlash**: The process went so wrong that it temporarily disrupts your Allomantic abilities. You are unable to use your Allomantic powers until you spend a full day recovering.

### Ingest Metal

You consume 1 use of a specific Allomantic metal or alloy and absorb it into your system/body, **Roll+CON**:

- **On a 10+**: You gain 2 holds. Suffer the negative effects of the metal. Choose one of the following:
    - **Ready action**: You can burn one use immediately.
    - **Effective absorbtion**: Extend the duration of the ingested metal by 2 holds.
    - **Contained use**: Prevent negative effects from the metal.
- **On a 7-9**: You gain 2 holds and suffer the metal's negative effect.
- **On a miss**: You suffer the adverse reactions of consuming the metal, you suffer the negative effect of the metal and choose one from the following:
    - **Nausea**: The metal reacts badly in your body, making you feel nauseous. You must spend an action to recover or suffer -1 ongoing until you do.
    - **Metal Burn**: The metal burns "hotter" than expected, causing discomfort or minor burns. Take 1 small harm.
    - **Extrication**: Your body forcefully expels the metal in a violent moment. You gain no holds and suffer the negative consequences.

_**Note**: Ingest can be swallowed as a solution, absorbed through the skin of your hands, or other methods you can think of._

### Burn Metal

When you actively "burn" (akin to burning calories) an ingested metal to utilize its powers, using up 1 (or more/less) hold(s) of the holds gained from "Ingest Metal". Activate the power of a known Allomentic metal for a short period of time. (seconds to minutes, depending on the metal)

### Sense Metal Reserves

You can always feel the reserve of ingested metal in your system. You are aware of how much you can use before running out.

### Cleansing

Over more extended periods of time, all ingested metals will leave your body by themselves. When you rest for at least 4 hours, remove all holds for all ingested metals.

## Alignment

### Good

Utilize Allomancy to directly aid another.

### Neutral

Teach or reveal the secrets of Allomancy to the uninformed.

I sense a strange connection between \_\_\_\_\_\_ and the metals.

I once used my powers against/for \_\_\_\_\_\_ or their loved ones.

\_\_\_\_\_\_ does not fully understand the risks I take every time I burn a metal. I must make them see.

\_\_\_\_\_\_'s past is interwoven with mine, though they do not yet know it.

I have promised \_\_\_\_\_\_ that I will only use my powers for good, but it's a promise I struggle to keep.

\_\_\_\_\_\_ once saved me when my metal reserves ran out. I owe them a life-debt.

The metals react differently around \_\_\_\_\_\_. I must discover why.

\_\_\_\_\_\_ once found a rare metal for me. I must pay them back somehow.

I am teaching \_\_\_\_\_\_ the secrets of Allomancy, but I worry they may misuse it.

## Death Move: Metallic Legacy

_When you meet your end, you can use this move._

In your final moments, you burn all your remaining metals in a radiant surge.
Your allies gain a fleeting ability to use your metal's power once.

_Note: Your allies can use your current metal holds until they run out or they rest for a longer period of time. They have to roll Burn Metal for it with \**their* \* stats._

    The GM will answer truthfully, but keep in mind that the answer may not always be clear-cut or comprehensive.

### Steel Whirlwind

- **Description**: A quick burst of Steel pushes everything light away from you, creating a zone of defense or clearing an area.

### Advanced Prepare Metal

In your continued experiments with Allomantic preparations, you've discovered a technique to yield more from the same amount of resources, but the process is trickier and the stakes are higher.

Use up 2 times the metal cost of coins + 4 coins worth of chemicals to create 2 x INT + 2 uses of Allomantic metal.

Roll+WIS to determine the outcome.

- **On a miss**: You've made a grave mistake in preparation. The GM will decide the consequences. Choose from the following:
    - **Resource Drain**: Your preparation was so off that youâ€™ve wasted not only the intended materials but also additional resources. Lose an amount of coins **double** to the initial cost.
    - **Cuts**: You cut your hand with a sharp piece. *ouchie, ouchie* Suffer -1 ongoing until you rest for a longer or get healed.
    - **Explosion**: Your preparation goes horribly wrong, resulting in a small explosion. Take 1 harm (burn) and you are thrown into a chaotic situation.

_Requires: Master Allomancer_

- **On a 7-9**: Your experiments lead to unstable results. You get a hint of a new potential power, but using it is risky. Every time you use this metal or alloy, there's a significant chance of unexpected side effects.
- **On a miss**: The experimentation backfires. You suffer harm, a permanent Allomantic ailment, or attract unwanted attention due to the volatile nature of your experiments.

_Note: The discovery of new metals or alloys can significantly impact the narrative and balance of the game. Collaborate with your GM to ensure the newly discovered metal fits the story and world._

### Raw Allomancy

_Requires: Grandmaster Allomancer_

The temptation to ingest and burn unprocessed metals, driven by either audacity or necessity, is a testament to your boldness.

Tapping into the raw form of Allomancy, you engage with its unpredictable, wild, and potent nature. When you choose to ingest and subsequently burn an unrefined metal, make a roll+WIS.

- **On a 12+**: You tap into the raw power of the metal. There's a hint of wildness to the power, making it harder to control.

    - The effect is potent but short-lived, lasting half the usual duration.
    - You feel a significant drain, leaving you weakened or fatigued.
    - The power is unwieldy, and there's a chance it might go slightly awry.
- - On a 7-9\*\*, the raw metal's power is unpredictable. The GM will give you 1-3 options, each with a cost, complication, or unwanted side effect. Choose one to manifest.
- **On a miss**: The metal reacts violently within you. Suffer harm from metal poisoning, lose access to your Allomantic powers temporarily, or face other severe consequences.

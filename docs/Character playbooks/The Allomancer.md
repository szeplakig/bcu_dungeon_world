## Short Description
An **Allomancer* * is a unique being with the ability to harness the power of _specific_ metals or alloys, drawing upon their inherent properties to achieve feats that defy natural law. Through ingesting and "burning" these metals, they unlock latent abilities ranging from enhanced senses to manipulating objects or emotions.


Depending on their mastery and the quality of metal ingested, the strength of these effects can vary. Treading the line between science and magic, an Allomancer must be strategic in their metal use, balancing power with the potential for adverse effects.


Whether they're soaring through the skies with Steel pushes or sensing dangers before they arise with Tin, Allomancers are a force to be reckoned with in any scenario.


## Stats


Your maximum HP is 8+Constitution.


Your base damage is d6.


## Starting moves


### Novice Allomancer


 * **Description**: Your journey into the realm of Allomancy has just begun, and you've familiarized yourself with a few metals.
 * **Effect**: You can recognize, prepare, ingest, and burn up to 2 different Allomantic metals. These are locked in forever.


### Ingest Metal


When you consume a specific Allomantic metal or alloy, and store it into your system, roll+INT:


 * **On a 10+**, you gain 2 holds and can immediately burn one use without an extra action. Choose one of the following:
	 * **Unlimited power**: Automatically flair the metal (roll for that as well without using an extra action)
	 * **Extension**: Extend the duration of a previously accessed metal by 2 holds
	 * **Safety first**: Prevent negative effects from the metal
 * **On a 7-9**, you gain 2 holds. You can choose to immediately burn one use.
 * **On a miss**, you suffer the adverse reactions of consuming the metal and decide one from the following:
   * **Nausea**: The metal reacts badly in your body, making you feel nauseous. You must spend an action to recover, or suffer -1 ongoing until you do.
   * **Metal Burn**: The metal burns hotter than expected, causing discomfort or minor burns. Take 1 harm.
   * **Extrication**: Your body forcefully expels the metal in a violent moment. You gain no holds and suffer the negative consequences.


_Note: Ingest can be swallow as a solution, absorb through the skin of your hands, or other methods you can think of._


### Burn Metal


When you actively "burn" (akin to burning calories) an ingested metal to utilize its powers, using up 1 (or more/less) hold of that specific:

 * **On a 10+**, the metal's effects are strong and controlled, without unexpected issues.
 * **On a 7-9**, you use the metal effectively but also face its negative effects.
 * **On a miss**, the metal's effects are unpredictable. The GM decides the outcome, which might include increased negative effects or diminished positive ones.


_Note 1: Remember that each time you burn metal, it uses up 1 (or more/less, depending on circumstances) of the holds gained from "Ingest Metal"._
_Note: If you dare to Burn metals that you do not know (eg.: have not choosen), you get severe consequences choosen by the DM. Following Advanced Moves can overwrite this rule._


### Prepare Metal


Before you can use your Allomantic abilities, you must prepare a specific metal or alloy Allomentically for Ingestion.

This process is delicate and if done wrong, can cause harm or provide a weaker effect.

Use up 1 times the metal cost of coins + 4 coins worth of chemicals to create INT uses of Allomantic metal.

Roll+WIS to determine the outcome.

 * **On a 10+**, the metal is perfectly prepared.
 * **On a 7-9**, you prepare the metal but something happens, choose from the following:
     * **Lesser effect**: You create a Weak Allomatic metal batch. This means these powers are weaker.
     * **Accident**: You mess up during the process and hurt youself but still manage to complete the batch, take 1 harm.
     * **Wastage**
 * **On a miss**, you've made a grave mistake in preparation, the GM will decide the consequences.


### Sense Metal Reserves


You can always feel the reserve of ingested metal in your system. You are aware of how much you can use before running out.


#### Cleansing


Over longer periods of time, all ingested metals will leave your body by themselves. When you rest for at least 4 hours, remove all holds for all ingested metals.

I sense a strange connection between \_\_\_\_\_\_ and the metals.


I once used my powers against/for \_\_\_\_\_\_ or their loved ones.


\_\_\_\_\_\_ does not fully understand the risks I take every time I burn a metal. I must make them see.

I have promised \_\_\_\_\_\_ that I will only use my powers for good, but it's a promise I struggle to keep.


\_\_\_\_\_\_ once saved me when my metal reserves ran out. I owe them a life-debt.


The metals react differently around \_\_\_\_\_\_. I must discover why.


\_\_\_\_\_\_ once found a rare metal for me. I must pay them back somehow.

In your final moments, you burn all your remaining metals in a radiant surge.
Your allies gain a fleeting ability to use your metal's power once.

Use up 2 times the metal cost of coins + 4 coins worth of chemicals to create 2 x INT + 2 uses of Allomantic metal.

Roll+WIS to determine the outcome.

 * **On a 12+**, the metal is flawlessly prepared, producing even more than expected. Gain an additional use.
 * **On a 10-11**, the metal is perfectly prepared.
 * **On a 7-9**, you prepare the metal but with complications, choose from the following:
     * **Volatile batch**: The metal's effects are unpredictable. They might be stronger or weaker, decided by the GM during use.
     * **Draining process**: The intense concentration required leaves you exhausted. Take -1 forward to your next roll.
     * **Resource intensive**: You've consumed extra resources in the process. Use up additional coins worth of chemicals.
 * **On a miss**, the preparation goes horribly wrong. The GM will decide the severe consequences, which might include loss of materials, accidental harm, or even dangerous byproducts.


### Allomantic Intuition

Sense imminent danger related to metal or Allomancy.


### Metallurgical Mastery

_Requires: Master Allomancer_

Your insatiable curiosity and understanding of Allomancy drive you to experiment and discover unknown metallic powers.

Once a year, when you dedicate significant time and resources to uncover a new metal or alloy and its Allomantic properties, roll+INT.

 * **On a 12+**, you discover a new metal or alloy, understanding its properties perfectly. Describe its effects, and add it to your repertoire. It remains rare, and acquiring it might be an adventure on its own.

 * **On a 7-9**, your experiments lead to unstable results. You get a hint of a new potential power, but using it is risky. Every time you use this metal or alloy, there's a significant chance of unexpected side effects.
 * **On a miss**, the experimentation backfires. You suffer harm, a permanent Allomantic ailment, or attract unwanted attention due to the volatile nature of your experiments.


_Note: The discovery of new metals or alloys can significantly impact the narrative and balance of the game. Collaborate with your GM to ensure the newly discovered metal fits the story and world._


### Raw Allomancy

_Requires: Grandmaster Allomancer_

The temptation to ingest and burn unprocessed metals, driven by either audacity or necessity, is a testament to your boldness.

Tapping into the raw form of Allomancy, you engage with its unpredictable, wild, and potent nature. When you choose to ingest and subsequently burn an unrefined metal, make a roll+WIS.


 * **On a 12+**, you tap into the raw power of the metal. There's a hint of wildness to the power, making it harder to control.
 * **On a 10-11**, you harness the power of the unprocessed metal but not without difficulty. Choose one:
     * The effect is potent but short-lived, lasting half the usual duration.
     * You feel a significant drain, leaving you weakened or fatigued.
     * The power is unwieldy, and there's a chance it might go slightly awry.
 * * On a 7-9**, the raw metal's power is unpredictable. The GM will give you 1-3 options, each with a cost, complication, or unwanted side effect. Choose one to manifest.
 * **On a miss**, the metal reacts violently within you. Suffer harm from metal poisoning, lose access to your Allomantic powers temporarily, or face other severe consequences.


_Note: Using unprocessed metals can be a game-changing decision. Collaborate with your GM to ensure the effects and narrative implications are fitting for the situation._

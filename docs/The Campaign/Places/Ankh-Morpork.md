The dominant trade hub of the region, all but in name ran by it's powerful and rich merchant class. 

Has trouble feeding it's populace - most merchants will no longer sail the river to the [Butcher's Dock](Butcher's%20Dock.md) due to rumours of undead in the river delta, and the farmlands in the same fertile land have been abandoned.

## Fronts

### The drowned of the river delta

The river used to be a great trade route between Ankh-Morpork and [Butcher's Dock](Butcher's%20Dock.md). However, lately, there is talk of drowned corpses of rowers rising back up in the marshes of the delta, and dragging boats to the bottom of the river.

Wheat and barley farmers started to refuse to enter the delta, leading to food problems in Ankh-Morpork, as they are forced to rely more and more on long trade routes from oversees, and imports form Cullfield.

#### The drowned

Corpses of rowers who died on the river, and were thrown overboard. They reanimate at the first sign of life, and drag boats underwater. They also attack anyone wandering into the floodplains on foot.

* *Impulse:* to murder living things in the delta
* *Grim portents:*
  * A famously daring trader tries to cross the delta, and disappears
  * Ankh-Morpork starts rationing food, since they can't trade for seafood
  * The major of Ankh-Morpork begins making plans to emigrate large swathes of the population past the Spine to the Qoryawa Jungle.
* *Impending Doom:*
  * There is a famine in Ankh-Morpork, leading to -Population

#### The Sand Guild

The Sand Guild are a guild of merchants specialising in desert trade. Desert caravans are expensive, and risky, and with the river free, their profits were low. The risk is partly due to heat, and partly due to the creatures that roam the desert.

* *Impulse:* keep the status quo of the river not being traversable, get local government funding for caravans, and expeditions into the Sherp'enho.
* *Grim portents:*
  * The Sand Guild starts funding caravans to [Eldoria](Eldoria.md) through the desert, despite the risk
  * The Sand Guild successfully lobbies for a government funded expedition to clear a path through the desert
  * The Sand Guild secretly funds a Walker of the Waste to move into the floodplains
* *Impending Doom:*
  * The Sand Guild becomes the biggest merchant guild in Ankh-Morpork, the River Traders' Guild is dissolved

#### The Walker in the Waste

The Walker is an old necromancer who used to be a caravan guard hundreds of years ago. He made a deal with an ancient desert deity for survival in the desert, after being stranded, which sent him to travel around the continent. He now wanders the waste, remembering his old life less and less - tho he really doesn't like these new people in his ancestral desert, he wants to find his culture's lost towns as a first priority, before these savages destroy their remains.

* *Impulse:* find the lost towns in the desert
* *Grim portents:*
  * A caravan of the Sand Guild is destroyed, with a few traumatised survivors talking about a dark wizard in robes, turning people into pillars of salt
  * The Sand Guild contacts the Walker, and makes a deal with him. The Walker is spotted in the flood plains, commanding the army of undead
  * Units of drowned are spotted in the desert, looking for the lost cities, and the artifacts therein
* *Impending Doom:*
  * The Walker recovers the control artifact of a Crawling Apocalypse, and marches on Ankh-Morpork, betraying the Sand Guild, and trying to push all living out of the desert

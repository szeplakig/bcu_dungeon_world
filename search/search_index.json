They\u2019re the feelings, thoughts, and shared history that tie you together. You will always have at least one bond, and you\u2019ll often have more. Each bond is a simple statement that relates your character to another player character.

Resolution of a bond depends on both you and the player of the character you share the bond with: you suggest that the bond has been resolved and, if they agree, it is. When you resolve a bond, you get to mark XP. A bond is resolved when it no longer describes how you relate to that person. That may be because circumstances have changed\u2014Thelian used to have your back but after he abandoned you to the goblins, you\u2019re not so sure. Or it could be because that\u2019s no longer a question\u2014you guided Wesley before and he owed you, but he paid that debt when he saved your life with a well-timed spell. Any time you look at a bond and think \u201cthat\u2019s not a big factor in how we relate anymore\u201d the bond is at a good place to resolve. If you have a blank bond left over from character creation you can assign a name to it or write a new bond in its place whenever you like.

Your new bond may be with the same character, but it doesn\u2019t have to be.  When you write a new bond choose another character.

Choose a thought or belief your character holds that ties the two together and an action, something you\u2019re going to do about it.

For the character, this can be an ethical ideal, religious strictures, or maybe just a gut instinct. It reflects the things your character might aspire to be and can guide you when you\u2019re not sure what to do next. Some characters might proudly proclaim their alignment while others might hide it away. A character might not say, \u201cI\u2019m an evil person,\u201d but may instead say, \u201cI put myself first.\u201d  That\u2019s all well and good for a character, but the world knows otherwise. Buried deep down inside is the ideal self a person wants to become\u2014it is this mystic core that certain spells and abilities tap into when detecting someone\u2019s alignment. Every sentient creature in Dungeon World bears an alignment, be they an elf, a human, or some other, stranger thing. The alignments are Good, Lawful, Neutral, Chaotic, and Evil. Each one shows an aspiration to be a different type of person.  Lawful creatures aspire to impose order on the world, either for their own benefit or for that of others.  Chaotic creatures embrace change and idealize the messy reality of the world, prizing freedom above all else.  Good creatures seek to put others before themselves.  Evil creatures put themselves first at the expense of others. A Neutral creature looks out for itself so long as that doesn\u2019t jeopardize someone else\u2019s well-being. Neutral characters are content to live their lives and pursue their own goals and let others do the same. Most creatures are Neutral. They take no particular pleasure in harming others, but will do it if it is justified by their situation. Those that put an ideal\u2014be it Law, Chaos, Good, or Evil\u2014above themselves are harder to find. Even two creatures of the same alignment can come into conflict. Aspiring to help others does not grant infallibility, two Good creatures may fight and die over two different views of how to do right. </p>"},{"location":"Bonds%20and%20Alignment/#changing-alignment","title":"Changing Alignment","text":"<p>Alignment can, and will, change. Usually such a change comes about as a gradual move toward a decisive moment. Any time a character\u2019s view of the world has fundamentally shifted they can chose a new alignment. The player must have a reason for the change which they can explain to the other players. In some cases a player character may switch alignment moves while still keeping the same alignment. This reflects a smaller shift, one of priority instead of a wholesale shift in thinking.

Damage can never take a character below 0 HP.  Damage is determined by the attacker. Player characters deal damage according to their class, the weapon used, and the move they\u2019ve made. If a move just says \u201cdeal damage\u201d the character rolls their class\u2019s damage dice plus any bonuses or penalties from moves, weapons, or effects.

Use this damage any time the monster takes direct action to hurt someone, even if they use a method other than their normal attack.

Temporary or circumstantial armor works the same way as armor that you wear: 1 armor for partial cover, 2 armor for major cover.   Damage is dealt based on the fiction. Moves that deal damage, like hack and slash, are just a special case of this: the move establishes that damage is being dealt in the fiction. Damage can be assigned even when no move is made, if it follows from the fiction.   HP loss is often only part of the effect. If the harm is generalized, like falling into a pit, losing the HP is probably all there is to it. When the harm is specific, like an orc pulling your arm from its socket, HP should be part of the effect but not the entirety of it.

When a player describes their character doing something that triggers a move, that move happens and its rules apply. If the move requires a roll, its description will tell you what dice to roll and how to read their results. A character can\u2019t take the fictional action that triggers a move without that move occurring.

Attacking a dragon with inch-thick metal scales full of magical energy using a typical sword is like swinging a meat cleaver at a tank: it just isn\u2019t going to cause any harm, so hack and slash doesn\u2019t apply. Note that circumstances can change that: if you\u2019re in a position to stab the dragon on its soft underbelly (good luck with getting there) it could hurt, so it\u2019s an attack.  If the action that triggers the move could reasonably hurt multiple targets roll once and apply damage to each target (they each get their armor).

You defy danger when you do something in the face of impending peril. This may seem like a catch-all. It is! Defy danger is for those times when it seems like you clearly should be rolling but no other move applies. Defy danger also applies when you make another move despite danger not covered by that move. For example, hack and slash assumes that\u2019s you\u2019re trading blows in battle\u2014you don\u2019t need to defy danger because of the monster you\u2019re fighting unless there\u2019s some specific danger that wouldn\u2019t be part of your normal attack.  On the other hand, if you\u2019re trying to hack and slash while spikes shoot from hidden traps in the walls, those spikes are a whole different danger. Danger, here, is anything that requires resilience, concentration, or poise.  This move will usually be called for by the GM. She\u2019ll tell you what the danger is as you make the move. Something like \u201cYou\u2019ll have to defy danger first. The danger is the steep and icy floor you\u2019re running across. If you can keep your footing, you can make it to the door before the necromancer\u2019s magic gets you.\u201d Which stat applies depends on what action you take and your action has to trigger the move.  That means you can\u2019t defy danger from a steep and icy floor with a charming smile just so you can use Cha, since charmingly smiling at the icy floor does nothing to it.

When you\u2019re no longer nearby or you stop devoting your attention to incoming attacks then you lose any hold you might have had. You can only spend hold when someone makes an attack on you or the thing you\u2019re defending. The choices you can make depend on the attacker and the type of attack. In particular, you can\u2019t deal damage to an attacker who you can\u2019t reach with your weapon.  An attack is any action you can interfere with that has harmful effects. Swords and arrows are attacks, of course, but so are spells, grabs, and charges. If the attack doesn\u2019t deal damage then halving it means the attacker gets some of what they want but not all of it. It\u2019s up to you and the GM to work out what that means depending on the circumstances. If you\u2019re defending the Gem Eye of Oro-Uht and an orc tries to grab it from its pedestal then half effect might mean that the gem gets knocked to the floor but the orc doesn\u2019t get his hands on it, yet. Or maybe the orc gets a hold of it but so do you\u2014now you\u2019re both fighting over it, tooth and nail.  If you and the GM can\u2019t agree on a halved effect you can\u2019t choose that option.

Discerning realities isn\u2019t just about noticing a detail, it\u2019s about figuring out the bigger picture. The GM always describes what the player characters experience honestly, so during a fight the GM will say that the kobold mage stays at the other end of the hall.  Discerning realities could reveal the reason behind that: the kobold\u2019s motions reveal that he\u2019s actually pulling energy from the room behind him, he can\u2019t come any closer.

You know you\u2019re using parley when you\u2019re trying to get someone to do something for you by holding a promise or threat over them. Your leverage can be nasty or nice, the tone doesn\u2019t matter. Merely asking someone politely isn\u2019t parleying. That\u2019s just talking. You say, \u201cCan I have that magic sword?\u201d and Sir Telric says, \u201cHell no, this is my blade, my father forged it and my mother enchanted it\u201d and that\u2019s that. To parley, you have to have leverage.  Leverage is anything that could lure the target of your parley to do something for you. Maybe it\u2019s something they want or something they don\u2019t want you to do. Like a sack of gold. Or punching them in the face. What counts as leverage depends on the people involved and the request being made. Threaten a lone goblin with death and you have leverage. Threaten a goblin backed up by his gang with death and he might think he\u2019s better off in a fight.  On a 7+ they ask you for something related to whatever leverage you have. If your leverage is that you\u2019re standing before them sharpening your knife and insinuating about how much you\u2019d like to shank them with it they might ask you to let them go. If your leverage is your position in court above them they might ask for a favor.  Whatever they ask for, on a 10+, you just have to promise it clearly and unambiguously. On a 7\u20139, that\u2019s not enough: you also have to give them some assurance, right now, before they do what you want.  If you promise that you\u2019ll ensure their safety from the wolves if they do what you want and you roll a 7\u20139 they won\u2019t do their part until you bring a fresh wolf pelt to prove you can do it, for example.  It\u2019s worth noting that you don\u2019t actually have to keep your promise. Whether you\u2019ll follow up or not, well, that\u2019s up to you. Of course breaking promises leads to problems. People don\u2019t take kindly to oath-breakers and aren\u2019t likely to deal with them in the future.  In some cases when you state what you want you may include a possible promise for the creature to make, as in \u201cflee and I\u2019ll let you live.\u201d It\u2019s up to the target of the parley if that\u2019s the promise they want or if they have something else in mind. They can say \u201cyes, let me live and I\u2019ll go\u201d (with assurances, if you rolled a 7\u20139) or \u201cpromise me you won\u2019t follow me.\u201d</p>"},{"location":"Moves/Basic%20moves/#aid-or-interfere","title":"Aid or Interfere","text":"<p>When you help or hinder someone , roll+bond with them. \u2734On a 10+, they take +1 or -2 to their roll, your choice. \u2734On a 7\u20139, they still get a modifier, but you also expose yourself to danger, retribution, or cost. </p> <p>Any time you feel like two players should be rolling against each other, the defender should be interfering with the attacker.

Take it and stabilize or refuse and pass beyond the Black Gates into whatever fate awaits you. \u2734On 6-, your fate is sealed. You\u2019re marked as Death\u2019s own and you\u2019ll cross the threshold soon. The GM will tell you when.</p> <p>The Last Breath is that moment standing between life and death. Time stands still as Death appears to claim the living for his own. Even those who do not pass beyond the Black Gates catch a glimpse of the other side and what might await them\u2014friends and enemies past, rewards or punishment for acts in life or other, stranger vistas.  All are changed in some way by this moment\u2014even those who escape. There are three outcomes to this move. On a 10+, the Character has cheated Death in some meaningful way. He\u2019s escaped with something that, by rights, isn\u2019t his anymore. Death is powerless to stop this, but he remembers this slight. On a 7\u20139, the GM should offer a real choice with significant consequence.  Think about the behaviors of the character and the things you\u2019ve learned about him in play. Death knows and sees all and tailors his bargains accordingly. This is a trade, remember. Offer something that will be a challenge to play out but will lead the game in fun new direction. On a miss, death is inevitable. The most obvious approach is to say \u201cDeath takes you across the threshold, into his bleak kingdom.\u201d and move on.  However, sometimes Death comes slowly. You might say \u201cyou have a week to live\u201d or \u201cyou can feel the cold hand of Death on you\u2026\u201d and leave it at that, for now. The player may want to give in and accept death at this point\u2014that\u2019s okay. Let them create a new character as normal.  The key thing to remember is that a brush with death, succeed or fail, is a significant moment that should always lead to change. </p>"},{"location":"Moves/Special%20moves/#encumbrance","title":"Encumbrance","text":"<p>When you make a move while carrying weight you may be encumbered.
